            <h2>High Concept</h2>
            <p>A recreation of the Pizzatron 3000 minigame from Club Penguin. Prepare a pizza that matches the current order before the dough leaves the screen, but be careful not to make any mistakes or you'll have to start over. The conveyer belt will speed up and the orders will become more complex over time. Go for the highscore!</p>

            <h2>Genre</h2>
            <p>Arcade. Speed game, minigame, highscore-based</p>

            <h2>Platform</h2>
            <p>Desktop web and mobile web. The majority of the gameplay is click and drag, which can be accomplished with both a mouse and a touch screen.</p>

            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Professor Porky's Pizza Parlor, where the pizzas are ASS (Assembled Super Speedily)! Step into the shoes of a PPPP employee and bear witness to the chaos that goes on behind the scenes as you attempt to make as many pizzas as you can without messing up!</p>

            <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
            <p>I'm going for a simplistic, bright, whimsical, cartoon style, similar to the art style of the original club penguin game.</p>

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>For each order, players will have the option to add two different kinds of sauces (red sauce and white sauce), mozzarella cheese, and 4 types of extra toppings (pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, peppers). Players add toppings to the pizza by clicking on the ingredient box and dragging an ingredient onto the pizza dough. Extra toppings have to be added one at a time, and the order will specify the exact number that need to be added. Players can make 5 mistakes before they game over. The controls should be pretty intuitive to pick up, but I will also include instructions in the pause menu or underneath the game window if players need additional guidance.</p>

            <h2>Other</h2>
            <p>I was really addicted to this game when I was younger, and it is a LOT harder than it seems! I distinctly remember mobile controls being far easier than using a mouse, so if you wnat the highscore I'd suggest playing this one on mobile.</p>
